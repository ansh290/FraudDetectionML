# FCB Detection

## IDENTIFYING VALIDITY OF TRANSACTIONS.
Objective of this work is to perform exploratory data analysis on the financial transaction provided in
the form of excel spread sheet and identify suitability of machine learning algorithms and propose the
one that is likely to produce an effective model in the long run.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Financial fraud and baseless chargebacks have been a problem for businesses. Increasing dependence
on new technologies such as cloud and mobile computing in recent years has compounded the
problem. Traditional methods of data analysis have long been used to detect fraud. They require
complex and time-consuming investigations that deal with different domains of knowledge like
financial, economics, business practices and law. Fraud instances can be similar in content and
appearance but usually are not identical. (ref: G.K. Palshikar, The Hidden Truth – Frauds and Their
Control: A Critical Application for Business Intelligence, Intelligent Enterprise, vol. 5, no. 9, 28 May 2002,
pp. 46–51.). Machine learning algorithms are in perfect spot to take charge and spot fraudulent activity
before it happens as trends in financial transactions continue to evolve along with method, data,
technology and consumer habits.

This work is focused on spotting fraud indicator and chargeback indicators given a sample of over 88k
financial transactions.
